# Data-Warehouse-ETL-Project

A data warehousing project built using SQL Server, SSIS, and Visual Studio.

---

## 📁 Project Overview

The aim of this project was to:

- Select a real-world OLTP dataset
- Design and implement a dimensional data warehouse model
- Perform ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) using **SSIS**
- Handle accumulating fact tables
- Demonstrate BI capabilities using SQL Server tools

---

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies

- **SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)**
- **SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS)**
- **Visual Studio**
- **CSV/Text/Excel Data Files**
- **Star/Snowflake Schema**
- **Dimensional Modelling & Slowly Changing Dimensions**

---

## 🧾 Selected Dataset

**Project Theme**: *General Hospital Management System*  
A simulated OLTP dataset capturing transactional and operational data across various hospital entities such as:

- Patients (Demographics)
- Encounters (Visits)
- Accounts (Financials)
- Physicians and Departments
- Hospitals and Branches
- Orders and Clinical Results

🟢 Data covers ~1 year and supports ETL, dimensional modeling, and OLAP use cases.

---

## 🧬 Data Sources

Two types of data sources were used to simulate real-world integration:

- **Source 1 – Flat File (CSV)**  
  `Patients.csv`: Simulates an external intake system  
  Contains: PatientID, Name, DOB, Gender, Address, etc.

- **Source 2 – SQL Server Database**  
  `GeneralHospital DB`: Includes Encounters, Departments, Hospitals, Accounts, etc.

This multi-source setup allowed demonstration of **ETL pipelines**, **lookups**, and **cleansing**.

## 🏗️ Solution Architecture

![Screenshot](Screenshots/SolutionArchitecture.png)


| Component        | Description |
|------------------|-------------|
| **Source Systems** | CSV and SQL Server OLTP |
| **ETL Layer**     | SSIS for extract-transform-load |
| **Staging DB**    | Intermediate cleaned/raw tables |
| **Data Warehouse**| Snowflake schema with Dim & Fact tables |
| **OLAP Layer**    | SSAS Cube (for hierarchies, KPIs, drill-downs) |
| **BI Tools**      | Power BI / SSRS for reporting and dashboards |

---

## 🗃️ Data Warehouse Design

A **Snowflake Schema** centered on the `FactEncounters` table was developed. Dimensions include:

- **DimPatient** *(SCD Type 2)*
- **DimDepartment**
- **DimHospital**
- **DimDate**

🔧 **Design Highlights**:
- Surrogate keys for all dimensions
- Patient info supports version tracking (SCD2)
- Department-Hospital foreign key for integrity
- Date dimension pre-generated (1+ years)

---

## ⚙️ ETL Process (SSIS)

Built with **SSIS**, the ETL pipeline includes:

### 🔄 Extraction
- Flat File Source for `Patients.csv`
- OLE DB Source for `Encounters`, `Departments`, `Accounts`

### 🧼 Transformation
- Data type conversion (e.g., DT_WSTR to DT_STR)
- Derived columns to clean IDs and normalize text
- Lookups to retrieve surrogate keys
- Merge Joins (e.g., Encounters + Accounts)
- Handling **Slowly Changing Dimensions (SCD Type 2)** using conditional splits and update flows

### 📥 Loading
- Dim tables loaded in order: `Date → Hospital → Department → Patient`
- `FactEncounters` loaded with keys and computed metrics (e.g., Length of Stay, Financials)

---

## 🕒 Accumulating Fact Table Handling

To simulate delayed updates:

- `accm_txn_create_time`: Set during initial load using `GETDATE()`
- `accm_txn_complete_time`: Updated later via separate ETL job
- `txn_process_time_hours`: Calculated using `DATEDIFF`

SSIS pipeline included:
- Derived Column for timestamps
- SQL-based `OLE DB Command` to perform updates

---

## 📊 Key Capabilities Demonstrated

✅ Multi-source data ingestion  
✅ Snowflake schema modeling  
✅ Surrogate key management  
✅ Lookup and transformation in SSIS  
✅ Slowly Changing Dimensions (Type 2)  
✅ Accumulating fact table updates  
✅ Staging & intermediate validation  
✅ Clean documentation with screenshots  

---

## 📈 Reporting & OLAP Support

Though not implemented in detail in this phase, the model supports future expansion via:
- **SSAS Cubes** (for rollups, KPIs, drill-downs)
- **Power BI Dashboards** (for hospital analytics)
- **Excel PivotTables** (for ad hoc insights)
